There are 2 types of feature scaling 
1. Standardization
2. Normalization

Impact of outliers - Standardization do not bring any change to outliers, they will still remain.

Don't use Standardization in case of algo like Decision Tree because scale don't matters.
It is mostly used in k-means, k clustering, pca, ann, gradient descent

Types of Normalization - 
1. Min max Normalization(brings data in range of [0,1])
2. Mean Normalization (-1 to 1)
3. MaxAbsScaling(used in sparse matrix - when 0's are in major quantity)
4. Robust Scaling(robutst to outliers)

Normalization v/s Standardization - when to use what?
1. first question should be that whether feature scaling is needed or not?
2. In most cases use Standardization
3. In case of images use min-max scaling
4. Try to explore few options to figure out the best one
